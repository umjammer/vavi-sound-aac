JAAD is an AAC decoder and MP4 demultiplexer library written completely in Java.
It uses no native libraries, is platform-independent and portable.
It can read MP4 container from almost every input-stream (files, network sockets etc.)
and decode AAC-LC (Low Complexity) and HE-AAC (High Efficiency/AAC+).
